Sidebery provides the list of tabs structured in a tree and bookmarks within the customizable panels. It aims to be fast, beautiful* and configurable. Some of the key features:

<strong>- Vertical tabs layout (flat or tree)</strong>
You can use a simple flat list of tabs or tree structure. Tree layout allows you to fold sub-tries, creates groups with a custom name to organize open pages.

<strong>- Bookmarks panel</strong>
Simple catalogs of your bookmarks. You can drag and drop links or tabs to create bookmarks and vice-versa. Basic operations: open in new window / sort / create / edit / delete.

Other bookmarks features:
- Automatically delete an open bookmark from "Other Bookmarks" folder.
- Highlight open bookmarks and activate its tab instead of opening new on clicking.

<strong>- Tabs panels</strong>
Configurable panels will help you sort your tabs.

<strong>- Containers management</strong>
You can set "Include" and "Exclude" url-rules, proxy config and UserAgent header for each container.

<strong>- Customizable context menu</strong>
Sidebery allows you to change the context menu for tabs and bookmarks. You can enable/disable/move different options, create sub-menus/separators.

<strong>- Multi-selection with right mouse button</strong>
You can select multiple tabs or bookmarks only with the mouse - push right mouse button and then move the cursor to adjust selection range.
(note: This feature is not working with the native context menu.)

Also, you can use ctrl+click/shift+click method or use keyboard shortcuts.
